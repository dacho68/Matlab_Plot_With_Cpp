Matlab_Plot_With_Cpp
====================

This is a extremely easy demo showing you how to use Matlab function to draw a plot using c++. You will be able to visualize the plot without even opening Matlab windows. It will just run in background and show you the plot you need. 

====================

Motivation of doing this: 
I am using OpenCV and C++ for most of my vision projects because of running speed. However, I really want to utilize Matlab to visualize some of my results, e.g. the histogram of an image. This piece of code become very handy to use because I cam just call Matlab functions from within my C++ projects. 

====================

This project is build on the following platform: 
 - Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
 - Matlab 2009b

Configuration:
